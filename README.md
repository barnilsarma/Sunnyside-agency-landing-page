## Table of contents

Overview:
This website showcases the use of HTML,CSS and Javascript. Here, we see the details of a hypothetical company. Mobile view of the website involves every part to be arranged in column format. Also, since the width of the mobile view is a bit less, so some options are included inside the menu-box, which is visible on clicking the top right buton. The desktop view of the website involves some parts to be arranged in rows while others to be arranged in columns. 
The challenge:
The challenge is to create the website using HTML,CSS and Javascript only and matching the requirements as much as possible.

My Process:
My first priority was to make the website first according to mobile view. Media Queries have proven to be useful for doing so.
I started my project with first including the whole visible content under a single <main> tag. In this way I could make common changes like positioning of individual parts by using the relative position of the <main> element. 
Then, I began to arrange the text content in a rough manner so as to make the webpage look more meaningful and systematic. For the arrangement of the elements in rows or columns, using flex display is one of my favourite ways since it reduces the need for indiviual positioning of interrelated items.
Then I began to add more and more formatting features as per the challenge and finally I completed the challenge.
Built With:
Languages-> HTML,CSS and Javascript
Image Formats used-> jpg,svg,png
Text-editor used-> Visual Studio Code
What I learned:
Through the project, I became more familiar with flex display. I also became more comfortable with javascript.
Acknowledgements:
I would like to thank frontend mentor for providing the challenge because of which I could become more comfortable with frontend development.
Also thanks to Vercel through which I could deploy my project for free.
